# egpdIDF: Intensity Duration Frequency model (IDF) using the Extended Generalised Pareto Distribution

The package put together functions to model Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves, using the Extendend Genaralized Pareto Distribution of Naveau et al. 2016.
This is  based on the work by Haruna et al. 2023.
